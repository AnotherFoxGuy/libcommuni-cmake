NOTES: ICU support is enabled by default. If you do not have ICU installed or
       if you want to disable the ICU support for other reasons, you may pass
       additional "-config no_icu" parameters to qmake.

       Deprecated functionality is enabled by default. If you do not need
       deprecated backwards compatible functionality (introduces small
       overhead), you may pass additional "-config no_deprecated" parameters
       to qmake.
